# helicopter-fatigue-analysis
This repository contains the analysis code and dataset for a study examining helicopter pilot fatigue across different flight types.

The analysis investigates:
- Changes in fatigue levels before and after flight,
- Differences between instructional and operational missions,
- Relationships between objective (PVT) and subjective (KSS, SP) fatigue measures,
- The effect of instructional workload on fatigue.

# Dataset
24 flight records from 12 helicopter pilots

Fatigue measured via:
- PVT (Psychomotor Vigilance Test),
- KSS (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale),
- SP (Samnâ€“Perelli Fatigue Scale).
